## Description
RunTrainer is a web application that offers training plans for different running distances. Users will be able to select a training plan for a specific distance, and follow the training plan by logging their runs to correspond with the plan.
Users can also log their runs independently of the training plan.

## Details for teaching team
I wanted to add way more functionality to this plan than I was able to do given the time limits, and the struggles I had with getting the database set up and the seeds working.

Specifically:
1. I wanted a user to be able to input time and distance of run and have a formula that calculates pace. I was having difficulty figuring out the appropriate data field to use for the run duration. All i could come up with was a smallinteger field from which i would then need to calculate the time in human-readable format.
2. When a user selects a running plan, I wanted to have it be added to his/her profile so that they could log their runs to match up with the plan's calendar.


## Outside code
